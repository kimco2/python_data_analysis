# Introduction to analysing data in Python

 ### **Overview**
An early project undertaken to understand how to analyse data in Python.  Two datasets were analysed:
 - Dataset 1 - looking at financial data
 - Dataset 2 - looking at election results

### **Folder structure**
There are two folders *PyBank* and *PyPoll*.  Each contain:
 - A file called *main.py* which contains the python code.
 - An additional folder called *analysis* which contains the output text file from when the code has been run (output.txt).
